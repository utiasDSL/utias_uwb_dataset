static signal testing

/cf2/log1:  ["tdoa3.d1-2",        "tdoa3.d2-1",    "tdoa3.d2-1",     "tdoa3.snr_1", 
             "tdoa3.powerdiff_1", "tdoa3.snr_2",   "tdoa3.powerdiff_2"]

/cf2/log2:  ["tdoa3.an1_rx_snr", "tdoa3.an1_rx_powerdif", "tdoa3.an1_tof",
             "tdoa3.an2_rx_snr", "tdoa3.an2_rx_powerdif", "tdoa3.an2_tof"]

For an_tag nlos metal trial 9, the bias is around -3.9 [m], and the SNR of anchor1 is ~51.09, power_diff is ~17.29
For other metal trials, the bias is around -0.2 ~ -0.5 [m], and the SNR of anchor1 is ~23, power_diff is ~21.89.

The reason is that, in trial 9, it is likely the metal cabenit totally block the los signal. UWB tag receives a multipath signal from anchor 1 (likely reflected from the roof). Therefore, in this trial, the signal quality is better, yet the meas. errors are larger.
